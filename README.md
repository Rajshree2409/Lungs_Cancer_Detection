# Lungs_Cancer_Detection
This project involves building a deep learning model to detect lung cancer from medical imaging data using Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) and Azure GPU Virtual Machines. The main objective is to develop an automated system that can accurately identify the presence of lung cancer in CT scan images.
